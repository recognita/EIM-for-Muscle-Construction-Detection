The application of machine learning methods to EIM signal analysis demonstrates high accuracy in upper limb prosthesis control tasks. This work presents an algorithm for classifying upper limb prosthesis movement types based on EIM recordings of antagonist muscles using machine learning models. An effective filtering and quantization method is proposed for training dataset formation. The obtained results show high accuracy (up to 0.95) and strong sensitivity to different movement classes. Future improvements may include using more complicated models and increasing the dataset size.
